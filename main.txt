a) The height of a binary tree with n elements is log n. 
b) Lower bounds of a height h tree is log n - h. Upper bounds is h^2
c) It will exist at height 0, the leaves of the tree. This is because all trees in a max heap are already max heapified, therefore the lowest children have the smallest values below them. 
d) Yes.
